# Take Home Pre Work

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The Purpose of this project was to test my ability to thoroughly plan, build and execute a simple React Application taking no more than 8 hr in order to be treated like a take home interview exam.
